# IoT-based-Smart-Irrigation-System
In this Project, I will work with Smart irrigation System that has wide scope to automate the complete irrigation system. Here I will be building an IoT based Irrigation System using ESP8266 NodeMCU Module,Arduino Uno , Soil Moisture Sensor Module and DHT11 Sensor. It will automatically irrigate based on the moisture level in the soil, Temperature and Humidity of ambient and also send the Data to ThingSpeak Server to keep track of the land condition. The System also consist of a water pump module which will be used to sprinkle water on the land depending upon the land environmental condition such as Moisture, Temperature and Humidity.
